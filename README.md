# Matrices-Inverter
Inverts 3 by 3 matrices that are not singleton matrics (was very helpful throughout my 12th grade)

## Story time (drum roll.. )
So I was at my periodic math test. I had to invert a matrix to find the solutions of 3 equation. I don't know how but somehow I forgot to multiply a -1 in the A32 position of the matrix. Hence I lost a mark in that test. Such a big disappointment (Steven's dad is surely gonna call me a failureee). So later while solving other inverse matrix quetions, I realised one thing. Finding an inverse of matrix is a step by step process which can be done even by a basic code. So why not just make a code that does the exact same ? So there it started and I went on to spend 3 hours to properly imply the logic well and correctly but hey I did it :)

## What can it do ?
It can just invert a 3 by 3 matrix that's all
